            Its been a busy month spacefans, the now finished Cassini mission continues to deliver, we celebrate the birth of a cute baby planet, and there are some treats ahead if you like gazing at the sky! COMPLEX ORGANIC MOLECULES FOUND AT ENCELADUS We already know that organic molecules had been discovered by Cassini as it dived repeatedly through the little moon’s plumes. However, by going over the data in more detail, scientists have discovered far more large, complex molecules which are hard to find beyond our own planet and makes it more likely that it could be a suitable habitat for life. Deep hydrothermal vents like we have here on Earth churn together materials from the moon’s huge subsurface ocean and its warm porous core, which it then releases into space via cracks such as its famous ‘Tiger stripes’, in the form of water vapor and ice grains. A science team led by Frank Postberg and Nozair Khawaja of the University of Heidelberg, Germany, is continuing the study of the the makeup of this ejected material and has recently identified fragments of large, complex organic molecules. The process that create these molecules are the same as processes here on Earth and particularly reminiscent of processes on the young Earth, a kind of biotic soup beloved of evolutionary scientists everywhere.
